# Description
My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to work with jquery and local storage working in conjuction with API calls.
I made this to show my understanding of these topics as well as practice different aspects of the fetch functions.  
This solves my issues by giving me reference tool to go back and look into how to do these fetch issues. I will also be using this as a tool for hiring managers.
The largest thing I learned from this project is how to correctly split the string for the fetch calls to add information that was grabbed.  I also had to spend a long time looking into how to sort through the data I received back the fetch to grab what I needed. 

# Installation
I started with making the HTML framework for all of this.  This included all the div's and sections with the id's and classes I thought i needed on first run through.  I then went through some basic CSS information to style the page.  I then spent a long time (and a tutoring sesson) looking into fetch and pulling all of the information.  After finally getting most of that sorted, I needed to work on the style of the different information that I pulled off. Then I realized my browser has a "force dark mode" button pressed, so I had change my css for the standard page that I was looking for.
